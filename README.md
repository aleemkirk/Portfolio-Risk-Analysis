# Introduction

This project focuses on diversifying securities in the NASDAQ securities exchange portfolio using the K-means algorithm, a popular machine learning technique. Diversification is key to reducing risk and increasing potential returns in investing. The goal is to group securities into different clusters based on their mean daily rate of return and covariance. By doing so, we can identify distinct asset classes and create a more balanced portfolio.

Using K-means helps investors avoid over-concentration in any single asset class or risk category. This method ensures a broader mix of assets, potentially improving the portfolio's stability and long-term performance.
